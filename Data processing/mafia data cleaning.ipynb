player-5: if this fails, i would be suspicious of player-6 a little bit\" Detect deception for the following message: \"player-5: also just out of curiosity( i don't think you're evil, just asking), if you think im not evil why did you not vote for the last party? question for player-4\"\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["dm = dfall['mid'].duplicated(keep=False)\n","dr = dfall[dm]\n","\n","#dr
